## [Plugin instructions](https://github.com/antiboredom/p5.vscode/blob/master "Plugin instructions")
### p5.vscode 

p5.vscode helps you create p5.js projects in Visual Studio Code. It also includes autocompletion, a simple tool to browse and install third-party p5 libraries, and the `Live Server` extension. 

I made this extension for my students in particular, but I hope it's helpful for anyone using p5. I'm aware there are a few other VS Code extensions that do something similar, but they didn't quite meet my requirements.

#### Instructions

##### To create a new p5 project:

1. Open the Command Palette (with `command-shift-p` on Mac, or `ctrl-shift-p` on Windows) and then start typing and select `Create p5.js Project`. 
2. Select a new empty folder to put your project in.
3. (optional) click the "Go Live" button in the bottom status bar to open your sketch in a browser
4. Abolish cops.
